('Understanding Multi-Level Marketing & Our Mission', 'Welcome to Soul Outreach! This guide will help you understand what Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) is, why we use it, and how it aligns with our biblical mission.

**What is Multi-Level Marketing (MLM)?**
Multi-Level Marketing is a business model where you earn money in two ways:
1. Direct sales commissions from your own referrals
2. Commissions from the sales made by people you recruit (your "downline")

In our case, instead of selling products, you''re sharing the Gospel and inviting people to join our discipleship community. When they become members, you earn commissions.

**Why Do We Use MLM for Ministry?**
We believe this model aligns perfectly with biblical principles:

1. **Everyone is Called to Ministry**: Jesus commanded us in Mark 16:15-20 to "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." This isn''t just for pastors - it''s for every believer.

2. **Workers Deserve Their Wages**: Luke 10:7 says "the worker deserves his wages." Those who choose to be in ministry should be compensated for their work in advancing God''s kingdom.

3. **Money as a Tool, Not a Master**: We don''t love money (1 Timothy 6:10 warns that the love of money is the root of all evil), but we use it as a tool. If financial incentives help motivate people to share the Gospel and win souls, why not use that motivation for good?

4. **Kingdom Economics**: We believe in creating a Kingdom economy where those doing God''s work are supported financially, allowing them to focus more time and energy on ministry.

**How This Benefits Everyone:**
- **New Believers**: Get access to quality discipleship and community
- **Affiliates**: Earn income while doing what they''re called to do anyway
- **The Kingdom**: More souls are won and disciples are made
- **The Church**: Sustainable funding for global ministry

**Our Heart Behind This:**
We''re not trying to get rich - we''re trying to get people saved and discipled. The MLM structure simply provides a sustainable way to fund this mission while rewarding those who participate in the Great Commission.

Remember: The goal isn''t to make money. The goal is to make disciples. The money is just a tool to help us do that more effectively.', 'getting-started', 1),

('Commission Structure Made Simple', 'Understanding how you earn money in Soul Outreach is straightforward once you know the basics.

**Base Commission Structure (All Tiers):**

- **Level 2 (People they refer)**: 10% of their monthly membership  
- **Level 3 (People Level 2 refers)**: 5% of their monthly membership
