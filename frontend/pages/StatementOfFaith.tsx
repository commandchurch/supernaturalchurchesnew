Every other religion or faith talks words but they don't have the power to heal the sick, cast out demons or raise the dead. They can't even talk to the rain and tell the rain to stop raining.

          <div className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed space-y-4">
            <p>
              At Supernatural Churches, we hold a fundamental belief that humanity is composed of spiritual beings temporarily dwelling in earthly bodies, each with a soul. The soul serves as the seat of our carnal mind, where emotions, feelings, and thoughts find their abode. The physical body, often referred to as the flesh, serves as the vessel that cloaks the invisible spirit, bestowing life upon our earthly existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our conviction, every man and woman is meticulously crafted in the image of God, reflecting His divine attributes. This intrinsic likeness to our Creator is woven into the very fabric of our being.The human body, or flesh, operates primarily through the five sensesâ€”taste, smell, vision, hearing, and touch. These senses enable us to interact with the physical world around us.However, it is the spirit within us that embodies our true essence. When our earthly journey comes to an end, our spirit lives on, destined for either the eternal bliss of Heaven or the somber depths of Hell.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that as Christians, we become new spiritual creations, and our spirit possesses a spiritual mind. Our mission at Supernatural Churches is to assist fellow believers and church ministries in bridging the gap between their perfect spirit and their carnal mind, renewing their thoughts and attitudes to become more Christ-like on Earth. It is through the alignment of our renewed minds and bodies with the Spirit of God that divine works manifest in our lives, allowing God to operate effectively through us to impact the world for His glory.

            <p>
              We believe, as Scripture attests, that by Jesus' wounds we have been healed. Grounded in the Holy passages of Isaiah 53:5, Matthew 8:17, and 1 Peter 2:24, our faith maintains that believers can reside in a continuous state of divine health, protected from illness and affliction. Quick to recover from pain or anything that may try opress the flesh. Yet, even as our earthly journey may occasionally bring minor mishaps or unforeseen events, we fervently counteract any profound misfortune and assert God's shield over all disciples in the powerful name of Jesus. Embracing and cherishing this truth, we confide in His pledge of restoration and safeguard. Additionally, we affirm that just as faith in the sanctity of Jesus' blood is essential for the gracious gift of salvation, similarly, faith in His broken body bestows upon believers the free gift of divine health. Nonetheless, to truly receive these divine blessings, one must approach with unwavering faith, avoiding a double-minded stance towards God and His Word (James 1:8). We do not force or advise anyone to stop taking medication or to stop following advice from medical professionals however we give people the word of God then let them decide what they think is best suited to them then they have an opportunity to choose which knowledge they want to serve. The knowledge of a doctors report or the knowledge of standing by faith in God's word for example. We provide factual information about the Bible and general advice and then personal advice to those who desire personal advice on the Holy Bible's opinions about one's choices and those people who want personal advice on their current situation then we provide it if they come to us for knowledge about God's word assuming consent is received if we're approached for opinions and/or advice on God's opinion or approach on a matter.

Our deep affection for both God and humanity is showcased by multiplying and nurturing disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ, both within our borders and abroad, employing all methods affirmed in the Holy Scriptures.
